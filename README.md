# Bike-share-analysis

## Project Overview
- This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data wrangling process using Python and Pandas on a bike-share dataset. Tasks included data inspection, cleaning missing fields, normalizing column names, converting datatypes, validating trip records, removing outliers, and engineering analytical features such as time-based breakdowns and trip categories.

## Reflections
. How the business problem influenced the wrangling decisions.

- As a data analyst, understanding business problems is crucial to analysis, as it helps make data-driven decisions.
- The business problem in this dataset helped define specific metrics that are used to measure data initiative success (peak rush hour, bike fleets and utilization rates, yearly analysis patterns, etc.).
- Without a well-defined business problem, a data analyst would be going in circles without solving any problem.
## Key Insights
- Popular Stations: A small number of stations account for a disproportionately high number of trips, indicating strong location-based demand.
- Peak Hours: Bike usage peaks during weekday morning and evening hours, suggesting commuter-driven usage.
- Subscriber Usage: Subscribers consistently use the service more frequently than casual users, showing stable and predictable demand.
- Days of the Week: Weekend usage exceeds weekday usage, reinforcing the role of bike-sharing for leisure.
- Seasonal Variations: Usage increases during favorable weather seasons and declines during colder or rainy periods.
- Yearly Trends: Overall usage shows growth over time, reflecting increasing adoption of the bike-sharing service.
- Fleet Utilization: Some bikes and stations are underutilized, indicating opportunities for redistribution and efficiency improvements.
## Business Recommendations
- Increase bike availability at high-demand stations during peak commute hours.
- Optimize fleet redistribution to reduce congestion at popular stations and improve usage at underperforming locations.
- Develop targeted subscription campaigns to convert casual users into long-term subscribers.
- Use seasonal demand patterns to inform maintenance scheduling and capacity planning.
- Monitor yearly usage trends to support data-driven expansion and infrastructure investment.
